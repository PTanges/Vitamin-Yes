    <div>Riboflavin (also known as vitamin B2) is one of the B vitamins, which are all water soluble. Riboflavin is
      naturally present in some foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement.</div>
    <p>This vitamin is an essential component of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN; also known as riboflavin-5’
      -phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These coenzymes play major roles in energy production; cellular
      function, growth, and development; and metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids<br><br>
